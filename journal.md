## What is my project?

I would like to use satellite imagery and weather data to predict wildfire occurences.

### Thursday, February 3rd

I read a survey of works using ML on various wildfire-related applications (Jain et. al, 2020. "A review of machine learning applications in wildfire science and management"). I focused on section 4.3, on "Fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk," and I found a number of studies that should help me get a good idea of existing work in the field. These have been uploaded to `./etc/bib/`, where I will be storing the papers I check out :)

I also took a shot at downloading images from the Sentinel 2 satellite, querying a specific place and time. I used the API's provided example: https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/data_search.html#Sentinel-Hub-Catalog-API. The exercise is in `./src/InitialExploration.ipynb`, a notebook where I will be running some preliminary efforts.
